We appreciate your concern and your report about our SPF record.

We do in fact use (~all, ?all) tp help ensure email deliverability at this time.

# SPF Reply options

We do not have plans to use -all at this time, as you may know most modern email systems actually will provide a warning for emails even if an SPF -all record is not used.

We are already in the process of moving to -all at this time but as you know this process can take time due to the requirements of ensuring email deliverability.

# DKIM reply options

We also do not solely rely upon SPF -all, we also use DKIM to ensure email is signed.

We also do not solely rely upon SPF -all, we also use DMARC with a policy of quarantine to ensure quarantining and reporting of suspicious emails takes place.
