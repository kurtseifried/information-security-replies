# DKIM reply options

We also do not solely rely upon DMARC, we also use DKIM to ensure email is signed.

# SPF Reply options

We currently use SPF, however we do not have plans to use an SPF record of -all at this time, as you may know most modern email systems actually will provide a warning for emails even if an SPF -all record is not used.

We currently use SPF, with a record set to -all and we generally rely upon this to prevent spoofing of email from our domain.

# DMARC reply options

We do not use DMARC at this time nor do we have plans to.

We use DMARC with a policy of none to ensure reporting of suspicious emails takes place.
